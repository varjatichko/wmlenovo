This software is reworked version of old wmlenovo and wmdell system health monitoring dock (NEXTStep/WindowMaker) applications. It's still based on wmbatteries code but added support of sysfs in addition to legacy /proc/acpi interface for both generic and Thinkpad platforms.

Main changes compare to previous (0.1.6 and 0.1.7) versions:
 - Generic sysfs hardware monitoring support
 - IBM/Lenovo ThinkPad support via sysfs
 - Dell I8K support (via /proc/i8k)
 - Support of 2x fans for Dell platform (two gauges, numerical value is displayed for the first fan only)
 - Tunable file's pathes (via configuration file)
 - Option to use separate color schemes for AC and BAT power
 - Added ability to execute commands on alert and power source switching
 - Minor bugfixes
 
Enjoy!
